ACPDeluxe
--------
	Use ACPDeluxe as described in the instructions provided with it.
	
 - Features
 	- Stations marked as closed (status collumn) apear in red and crossed out.
	- Stations with a 'relayed by' status (T=4ZZ) are connected to their relay by a dot-dash line.
		- Lines are color coded to identify the station relaying. i.e., If ZZZ4ZZ relays 4AA and 4AB the lines running from 4ZZ to 4AA and 4AB are the same color.
		
NCSPro
--------
	Use NCSPro as described in it's documentation.
	NCSPro does not auto-update StationMapper, rather StationMapper watches the PENDING_OUT folder for files with ROSTER in the filename and imports the newest file when changed.
 - Features
	- Planning to add closed and relayed by feature
	- No additional features have been added at this time.
	- SMv2 is depreciated software and further features are not being developed.
	
Calculator

        - Select two stations by right clicking them or selecting them from the dropdown box.  Distance and bearing are automatically updated each time the station changes.
        - Channel and Frequency Graphs are calculated based on the stations selected to the left.

          - Graphs are calculated based on:
            - The entered noise floor in dBm.
            - Using ideal horizontal dipoles pointed at each other.
            - Using the power selected in staiton parameters.
          - Graphs are displayed on the Progagation tab in the main windows.
          - Right clicking on the graph will allow you to close the graph.

	- Scroll wheel controls zoom level.
	- Mouse forward and back buttons adjust font scalar.
	- Left click and hold drags the map.

Changing Maps
--------
	From the menu select Configure->Choose Map
