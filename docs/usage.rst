Usage
========

Starting StationMapper
--------

 - Start StationMapper from the Windows Start menu or desktop shortcut.
 - If you are not using the internal NCS tool, start your preffered NCS Application.

		- NCS.exe - ACPDeluxe Suite

NCS Tools
--------
 - StationMapper NCS Roster Tool (Recomended)
 	- See documentation for NCS Tab for information on how to use the internal roster tool.
 - ACP Deluxe
	- Use ACPDeluxe as described in the instructions provided with it.
	- Features
 		- Stations marked as closed (status collumn) apear in red and crossed out.
		- Stations with a 'relayed by' status (T=4ZZ) are connected to their relay by a dot-dash line.
			- Lines are color coded to identify the station relaying. i.e., If ZZZ4ZZ relays 4AA and 4AB the lines running from 4ZZ to 4AA and 4AB are the same color.
 - NCSPro
	- Use NCSPro as described in it's documentation.
	- NCSPro does not auto-update StationMapper, rather StationMapper watches the PENDING_OUT folder for files with ROSTER in the filename and imports the newest file when changed.
	- Features
		- Planning to add closed and relayed by feature
		- No additional features have been added at this time.
		- SMv2 is depreciated software and further features are not being developed.
